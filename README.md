# relayctl
Simple bash scripts to control relays connected to your raspberry pi with a cron like scheduler to switch ac appliances on or off based on time of day, day of week and month of year. Useful to automate switching appliances on and off based on schedule.

Connect your relayâ€™s control circuit to one of the GPIO pins marked an **X** and GND, max 4 relays at this time.

Boot Raspberry Pi OS once logged in you can install relayct using the following command.

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReinierNel/relayctl/main/setup.sh | sudo bash
```

This start an interactive wizard, follow the prompts to install relayctl

1. Agree License Agreement 
2. Acknowledge that your Relays are connected
3. Select the GPIO Pins your relays are connected to
4. Enter an integer to represent how often the scheduler sould poll recommended is 10 seconds 
5. The next step will run a test to check if all your relays are working
6. End of installation wizard
