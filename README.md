# relayctl
Simple bash scripts to control relays connected to your raspberry pi with a cron like scheduler to switch ac appliances on or off based on time of day, day of week and month of year. Useful to automate switching appliances on and off based on schedule.

### Boot

Boot Raspberry Pi OS once logged in you can install relayct using the following command.

### Install

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReinierNel/relayctl/main/setup.sh | sudo bash
```

This start an interactive wizard, follow the prompts to install relayctl

## Update Schedule

Edit the following file /etc/relayctl/schedule.list 

Add an ```#``` in front of a schedule to disable it. To add a new schedule add a new line to the file and enter the following details separated by ```|```

|**schedule name**|**start time**|**end time**|**day of week**|**month**|**relay_index**|**on cmd**|**off cmd**|
|-----------------|--------------|------------|---------------|---------|---------------|----------|-----------|
|Geyser1|10:25:00|11:45:00|1 2 3 4 5 6 7|1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12|0|/home/pi/relayctl.sh -r=0 on|/home/pi/relayctl.sh -r=0 off
|Geyser2|15:00:00|16:30:00|1 2 3 4 5 6 7|1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12|1|/home/pi/relayctl.sh -r=1 on|/home/pi/relayctl.sh -r=1 off

### schedule name

Name of your schedule, will show up in the logs

### start time

Time to execute commands listed in **on cmd** section based on frequency set during the installation process

### end time

Time to execute commands listed in **off cmd** section based on frequency set during the installation process

### day of week

The day of the week to execute on e.g. 1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday etc.

### month

The month to execute on e.g. 1 = January 2 = February, etc.

### relay_index

Position of Relay e.g. 0 = Relay Connected to GPIO pin 22. etc.

### on cmd

Command to execute when the start time, day of week and month conditions are met 

### off cmd

Command to execute when start time, day of week and month conditions are not met

## Running Manual Relay Actions

> :warning: if there is a schedule running it will overwrite your manual action

See below commands

```bash
/etc/relayctl/relayctl.sh test
/etc/relayctl/relayctl.sh status
/etc/relayctl/relayctl.sh -r={enter relay index here} {on or off}
