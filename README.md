# relayctl
Simple bash scripts to control relays connected to your raspberry pi with a cron like scheduler to switch ac appliances on or off based on time of day, day of week and month of year. Useful to automate switching appliances on and off based on schedule.

### Boot

Boot Raspberry Pi OS once logged in you can install relayct using the following command.

### Install

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReinierNel/relayctl/main/setup.sh | sudo bash
```

This start an interactive wizard, follow the prompts to install relayctl

## Update Schedule

Edit the following file /etc/relayctl/schedule.list 

Add an ```#``` in front of a schedule to disable it. To add a new schedule add a new line to the file and enter the following details separated by ```|```

|**schedule name**|**start time**|**end time**|**day of week**|**month**|**relay_index**|**on cmd**|**off cmd**|
|-----------------|--------------|------------|---------------|---------|---------------|----------|-----------|
|Geyser1|10:25:00|11:45:00|1 2 3 4 5 6 7|1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12|0|/etc/relayctl/relayctl.sh -r=0 on|/etc/relayctl/relayctl.sh -r=0 off
|Geyser2|15:00:00|16:30:00|1 2 3 4 5 6 7|1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12|1|/etc/relayctl/relayctl.sh -r=1 on|/etc/relayctl/relayctl.sh -r=1 off

### schedule name

Name of your schedule, will show up in the logs

### start time

Time to execute commands listed in **on cmd** section based on frequency set during the installation process

### end time

Time to execute commands listed in **off cmd** section based on frequency set during the installation process

### day of week

The day of the week to execute on e.g. 1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday etc.

### month

The month to execute on e.g. 1 = January 2 = February, etc.

### relay_index

Position of Relay e.g. 0 = Relay Connected to GPIO pin 22. etc.

### on cmd

Command to execute when the start time, day of week and month conditions are met 

### off cmd

Command to execute when start time, day of week and month conditions are not met

## Setup enxternal switches

External switches are used to put on or off a relay if the switch state is open or closed

Edit the following file /etc/relayctl/inputs.list to map switches to relays

|**name**|**input index**|**relay index**|**mode**|**cmd**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|jojo 2400L ball valve|0|0|on|echo "hello world"|

### name

The name of the index mapping, arbitrary string to will appear in log files

### input index

The index of the input as set in ```settings.sh``` under variable ```inputs_gpio=()``` for instance if ```inputs_gpio=(5 6)``` 5 would be index 0 and 6 will be index 1

## relay index

The index of the relay as set in ```settings.sh``` under variable ```relays=()``` for instance if ```relays=(17 18)``` 17 would be index 0 and 18 would be index 1

The input index is mapped to the relay index.

## mode

Action to perform when external input is closed open.

mode **on** will switch on a relay if the external input is closed
mode **off** will switch off an relay if the external input is closed
mode **cmd** will run a command if the external input is closed and the cmd field is populated with a command

## cmd

This runs a command set under the cmd field if the external input is closed

> :warning: WIll only run if mode is set to cmd

## Running Manual Relay Actions

> :warning: if there is a schedule running it will overwrite your manual action

See below commands

```bash
/etc/relayctl/relayctl.sh test
/etc/relayctl/relayctl.sh status
/etc/relayctl/relayctl.sh -r={enter relay index here} {on or off}
